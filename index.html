        <p>
            Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, 
            the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business 
            of operating tours. The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, 
            in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday 
            activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment 
            for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and 
            other purposes". Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international, 
            and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments.

                <p>
                    According to the World Tourism Organization, a tourism product is:
                    "a combination of tangible and intangible elements, such as natural, 
                    cultural and man-made resources, attractions, facilities, services and 
                    activities around a specific center of interest which represents the 
                    core of the destination marketing mix and creates an overall visitor 
                    experience including emotional aspects for the potential customers. 
                    A tourism product is priced and sold through distribution channels 
                    and it has a life-cycle".

                <p class="headline">International tourism</p>
                <p>
                    International tourism is tourism that crosses national borders. 
                    Globalisation has made tourism a popular global leisure activity.
                    The World Tourism Organization defines tourists as people "traveling 
                    to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more 
                    than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes".
                    The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that up to 500,000 people 
                    are in flight at any one time
                </p>
                <p class="headline">History</p>
                <p>
                    Travel outside a person's local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes, 
                    who at times travelled to distant parts of the world, to see great buildings and works of art, 
                    learn new languages, experience new cultures, enjoy pristine nature and to taste different cuisines.

                <p class="headline">Middle Ages</p>
                <p>
                    By the Middle Ages, Christianity and Buddhism and Islam had traditions of pilgrimage. Chaucer's Canterbury 
                    Tales and Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West remain classics of English and Chinese literature.

                <p class="headline">Grand Tour</p>
                <p>
                    Modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the Grand Tour, 
                    which was a traditional trip around Europe (<span>especially Germany and Italy</span>), 
                    undertaken by mainly upper-class European young men of means, mainly from Western 
                    and Northern European countries. In 1624, the young Prince of Poland, Ladislaus 
                    Sigismund Vasa, the eldest son of Sigismund III, embarked on a journey across Europe, 
                    as was in custom among Polish nobility.

                <p>
                    Leisure travel was associated with the Industrial Revolution 
                    in the United Kingdom â€“ the first European country to promote 
                    leisure time to the increasing industrial population. Initially, 
                    this applied to the owners of the machinery of production, 
                    the economic oligarchy, factory owners and traders.

                <p>
                    Niche tourism refers to the numerous specialty forms of 
                    tourism that have emerged over the years, each with its 
                    own adjective. Many of these terms have come into common 
                    use by the tourism industry and academics. Others are 
                    emerging concepts that may or may not gain popular usage.
                    Examples of the more common niche tourism markets are:
